            At <strong>S.K. Mission School</strong>, facilities are not just
            about infrastructure — they are about creating an environment
            where students feel safe, motivated, confident, and inspired
            every single day.

          <p>
            From modern learning spaces to creative and physical development
            zones, every corner of our campus is designed to support
            academic excellence, discipline, and holistic growth.
