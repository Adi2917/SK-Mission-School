          <p>
            At S. K. Mission School, academics are not limited to textbooks or
            examinations. Our goal is to build a strong intellectual foundation
            that enables students to think independently, analyze deeply, and
            apply knowledge confidently in real life.
          </p>

          <p>
            Through structured learning, disciplined routines, and continuous
            academic guidance, we prepare our students to face future challenges
            with clarity, competence, and character. Every lesson, every class,
            and every assessment is designed with purpose — to create learners
            who are goal-oriented, responsible, and future-ready.
          </p>

          <p className="highlight">
            Our academic journey is driven by commitment, consistency, and a
            clear vision of excellence.
